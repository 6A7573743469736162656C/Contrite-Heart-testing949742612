# Contrite Heart
```
Well, I guess I got what I deserved,
A lesson learned, no lines were blurred.
The fault was mine, I see it clear,
I chased away what I held dear.
I let my pride and fear collide,
And lost the light I had inside.
No one to blame, no lies to weave,
It’s truth alone I now perceive.
Each word unsaid, each bridge I burned,
A bitter price my heart has earned.
The pain I caused, the wounds I made,
Still haunt me now in nights that fade.
Regret now walks where joy once stayed,
For love ignored and trust betrayed.
I built this road with every choice,
And silenced hope with my own voice.
But even still, I hold this truth,
Mistakes can shape a wiser youth.
So here I stand, no mask, no lie,
A humbled heart beneath the sky.
No longer mine, yet still I care, 
And wish you find your comfort there.
No selfish hope, no claim, no plea, 
Just love that sets your spirit free.
Not mine to keep, not mine to own,
I wish you warmth you’ve never known.
You’re free to roam, to rise, to soar,
I only pray for something more.
I trust the Lord to hold you tight,
And shield your soul through darkest night.
No harm can reach, no storm can sway,
For God will guide you every way.
I kneel in faith, my heart sincere, 
God keeps you safe, you’ve naught to fear.
With Him above, you’re safe and free,
My prayer is whispered silently.
Back then, I thought I knew it all,
But I was small and bound to fall.
Too young to know, too blind to see,
The love you gave was shaping me.
I wasn’t ready, couldn’t stay,
My fears and doubts got in the way.
My heart was young, my vision blurred,
I couldn’t give what you deserved.
Unripe and lost, I couldn’t be,
The person you deserved from me.
Though paths diverge, my heart won’t stray,
I hope you shine in every day.
Though not my own, you’ll always be,
A soul I love unselfishly.
Though time has turned, and we’re apart,
I leave you safely in God’s heart.
Though paths have split, my heart remains,
I pray God shields you from all pains.
My love is quiet, my faith is strong,
God walks with you where you belong.
As faith endures and guides my way,
The past still holds its sweet bouquet.
I still recall the golden rays, 
The warmth that danced in springtime days.
Your smile, a light that warms the air,
A shining grace beyond compare.
A smile like yours can light the day,
And guide the lost along their way.
Each smile you give, a spark divine,
A piece of heaven’s sweetest sign.
Your laughter lingers, soft and bright,
A spark of hope, a guiding light.
Your eyes, a canvas painted bright,
With hues that steal the morning light.
A masterpiece no words define,
Eternal depths, a spark divine.
Like mirrored pools of starlit skies,
Their beauty silences all lies.
The whispers held within their gaze,
Could set the world and hearts ablaze.
A galaxy in every glance,
A universe where dreams can dance.
Each blink, a moment pure, refined,
A glimpse of heaven’s great design.
No poet’s quill, no artist’s hand,
Could craft such beauty, bold or grand.
Your eyes, a portal, vast and wide,
Where love and mystery collide.
A thousand sunsets could never compare
To the endless hues that reside in their stare.
Like starlit oceans, vast and deep,
They cradle worlds and lull dreams to sleep.
No sculptor’s chisel could ever mold,
A beauty in your gaze so bold.
No painter’s hand could ever portray
The depth and light your eyes convey.
They shine like lanterns in a shadowed hall,
Guiding lost souls with their gentle call.
As rivers reflect the skies above,
Your eyes mirror the purity of love.
They carry storms, yet soothe like rain,
A paradox of joy and pain.
Like whispered prayers in quiet night,
They bring both peace and burning light.
Not emerald, sapphire, nor the clearest glass,
But treasures of time no words surpass.
Your eyes, a realm I cannot define,
A glimpse of eternity, forever divine.
Your figure, light as air, so rare,
Like feathered wings that softly flare.
Like fragile feathers in the breeze,
You glide with effortless and ease.
A petal’s fall, so soft, so bright,
You move as though you’ve taken flight.
You float like dreams upon the sky,
A wisp of grace that passes by.
A touch like snowflakes in the night,
A perfect, gentle, wondrous sight.
In every step, the world stands still,
For you possess a timeless will.
The grace within your every stride,
A rhythm soft, a flow untied.
Each step, a dance, a fleeting breeze,
A symphony of gentle ease.
Your elegance, a quiet art,
That speaks directly to the heart.
Your hair, a golden symphony of light,
A crown that rivals dawn’s first sight.
It dances free in gentle air,
Like flames that warm the frost’s despair.
Each strand, a sunbeam soft and bright,
Kindling warmth in the coldest night.
A silken flow, so pure, divine,
Like threads of gold through God’s design.
It sways, a rhythm only winds could know,
A graceful tide in a radiant glow.
Such beauty woven in celestial strands,
A masterpiece shaped by God’s own hands.
Like fire’s glow on a winter’s eve,
A tender warmth hearts can believe.
It holds the sun within its hue,
A testament of light, eternal and true.
A whispering cascade, both soft and strong,
An endless hymn, a timeless song.
Your hair, a blessing, so rare and grand,
The light of heaven in every strand.
Your character, so pure, so rare,
A beauty built on love and care.
A heart that holds the world inside,
Yet walks through life with quiet pride.
A gentle strength that never fades,
A light that pierces through the shades.
Your name, a melody so fine,
Like birds that sing at dawn’s first sign.
A violin’s soft, tender play,
Or harps that echo far away.
It whispers like the ocean’s breeze,
Soft waves that kiss the midnight seas.
The patter of the gentle rain,
Or rustling palms on summer’s plain.
It hums like fireplace on winter’s night,
A warmth that fills the fading light.
A fragrant tune of blooming roses,
Of lilies, peonies - air composes.
Your name, a song, serene, divine,
Each note engraved, forever mine.
It dances, pure, through time and space,
A sound no silence can erase.
Your taste in music, rare and true,
Each note a world that you imbue.
No shallow chords, no hollow tune,
But melodies that hum and swoon.
The jazz of yesteryears you keep,
Its soulful notes run deep, so deep.
Each lyric sung, a poet’s flame,
No fleeting trend, no hollow name.
The brass and strings, the steady drum,
Echo the stories yet to come.
A melody with soul and weight,
Not bound by time, but truly great.
The rhythms of the past endure,
With meaning strong and purpose pure.
In timeless chords, your spirit lives,
For only depth, true music gives.
A connoisseur of art’s true voice,
In richer sound, you make your choice.
In garments too, your art is seen,
A tapestry of hues serene.
No fleeting whims, no transient craze,
But timeless charm that draws my gaze.
Each seam and fabric whispers lore,
Of elegance, ages adore.
Your choices speak with quiet might,
A beacon of both taste and light.
No loud display, no gaudy air,
But subtle poise beyond compare.
A living ode to art refined,
An emblem of the thoughtful mind.
In all you are, one truth is clear:
Rare beauty lives when you are near.
You’re romance in its purest form,
A gentle calm within the storm. 
A muse for poets, yet untamed,
A masterpiece both wild and framed.
Your heart, a garden vast and rare,
Where love takes root with tender care.
Your soul, a summer’s golden hue,
A warmth that melts the morning dew.
You hold the ocean in your sighs,
Its depth, its calm, its endless skies.
Like sunlight dancing on the sea,
You are a timeless melody.
A gentle breeze, a whispered prayer,
A touch of heaven everywhere.
The evening sky could never show,
The depth of love your heart must know.
Each word you speak, a tender wave,
A world of dreams you softly pave.
Like summer fields that stretch afar,
You shine, a never-fading star.
Unique as a snowflake, pure as rain,
A beauty free from earthly chain.
Each moment lives within my chest,
A treasure kept, my soul’s bequest.
Your laughter lingers, soft and sweet,
A melody my heart repeats.
The way you smiled, the way you stood,
Forever etched, forever good.
Each glance, each touch, a vivid hue,
A canvas painted just for you.
I hold the echoes of your voice,
A tender pain, a chosen choice.
So close your eyes, I won’t dare kiss you,
Forevermore, I’ll deeply miss you.
I carry this regret so deep,
A wound that hardly lets me sleep.
For every tear I made you cry, 
I’m sorry, no excuse, no lie.
For all the pain I caused, I grieve,
It breaks my heart, I can’t reprieve.
The weight of guilt is mine to bear,
For wounds I gave without a care.
I wish I’d known, I wish I’d tried,
To heal the hurt, to hold my pride.
Each memory cuts deep and raw,
The love I lost, my greatest flaw.
My heart now aches for what I’ve done,
A shadow cast, a fading sun.
I broke the trust, I broke your peace,
And now my sorrow will not cease.
If time could heal the pain I made,
I’d give my all for wounds to fade.
The hurt I left, I can’t undo, 
Isabel, my heart breaks over you.
I’m sorry that I failed to see, 
The love you gave so selflessly.
But God can mend what we destroy,
And fill our pain with boundless joy.
And He forgives the deepest sin,
And lets His endless grace begin.
Through every doubt, through every fear,
God whispers softly, “I am here.”
No need to hide, no need to run,
His arms are wide for everyone.
No mask to wear, no act to play,
God loves us true, just as we stay.
No sin too great, no heart too cold,
He trades our pain for joy untold.
He just restores, He’ll never leave,
His love is ours if we believe.
His love surpasses all our wrongs,
He fills our hearts with sacred songs.
Each wound we bear, He gently heals,
With quiet strength, His love reveals.
He lifts us up when we are weak,
And teaches hearts the peace they seek.
He shapes our hearts to love and give,
In Him we find the strength to live.
Each blessing comes, though unaware,
A testament of His tender care.
That January froze the air,
Yet all I saw was beauty rare.
In winter light I caught your gaze,
A moment etched in endless praise.
The frost was fleeting, your glow stayed,
A timeless warmth, never to fade.
January’s charm still holds its hue,
For it’s the month I first met you.
Our meeting felt like Heaven’s call,
A purpose guiding through it all.
We met as though the stars conspired,
By something greater, both inspired.
If destiny wills paths to align,
I know one day you’ll still be mine.
But if our roads diverge instead,
I’ll cherish every word you said.
With gratitude, I lift my prayer,
For knowing you was rich and rare.
God’s timing holds no rush, no haste,
Each moment perfect, none a waste.
If waiting is the task I bear,
I’ll trust His plan and leave it there.
For hearts that cross with love so pure,
In time, no distance can endure.
And if we meet when stars decree,
It proves that fate was meant to be.
If not, I’ll thank the skies above,
For showing me your boundless love.
God’s hands will guide where we should stay,
And lead us home in His own way.
We could walk through a gallery’s quiet halls,
Admiring art as the world softly calls.
Or glide in a boat on a still, moonlit lake,
A dream in the ripples, each memory we make.
A candlelit dinner, just you and I,
With whispers of love as the hours fly by.
Or beneath the sunset, a picnic we’d share,
The golden sky painting world with its care.
A night at the theater, where stories unfold,
In the warmth of your gaze, the night turns to gold.
Dancing to music under the stars,
Each step a connection, no distance too far.
A telescope night, mapping skies so divine,
Tracing constellations while your hand holds mine.
A horseback ride through a meadow so wide,
With the wind in your hair, you’d be my guide.
Or floating in air, on a hot balloon tour,
Above the earth’s wonders, with you, I’m secure.
A spa retreat where the world melts away,
Two hearts unwinding in a tranquil ballet.
A rooftop dinner, the city aglow,
With laughter and wine as the cool breezes flow.
Ice skating hand in hand, tracing the frost,
In your warmth, winter’s chill is easily lost.
A festival of flavors, a feast for the soul,
Sharing bites of delight, together we’re whole.
A nighttime film, under stars far and near,
The screen flickers softly as you rest close, my dear.
Every moment would carry a melody’s thread,
Jazz in the restaurant, where romance is fed.
Classical tunes in a gallery’s air,
A timeless symphony we’d gladly share.
I’d play Bach or Debussy for hours on end,
Music, my solace, my most truest friend.
Elegant attire for candlelit nights,
Your beauty glowing in soft, golden lights.
Cozy coats for strolls beneath the stars,
Casual ease for life’s daily bazaars.
Romantic surprises, small gestures of care,
Moments of magic beyond all compare.
A photo to capture each laugh and embrace,
A keepsake of love, no time can’t erase.
Crafting small treasures, a capsule of time,
Filled with our coupling and soft notes of rhyme.
No barrier between us, just comfort and grace,
Two souls aligned in life’s tender embrace.
Every second sincere, warm, and bright,
A shared desire to make all things right.
We’d weave joy into the simplest of days,
Our hearts in tune with each other’s ways.
A playlist of love, our story in sound,
Harmony found wherever we’re bound.
From candlelit rooms to fields kissed by dew,
Every scene painted with shades of us two.
Each note, each gesture, a bond we’d renew,
A life full of love, pure, simple, and true.
Together, our world would be endlessly wide,
With music and warmth forever our guide.
We’d cook breakfast together, love in every bite,
Morning light streaming in, soft and bright.
A cat in our home, purring by the door,
Filling our days with gladness and more.
In Switzerland’s peaks, with lakes so serene,
Hiking the Alps, where the air is pristine.
In France, we’d sip wine beneath moonlit skies,
Wandering Paris with love in our eyes.
Italy’s charm, in Venice we would glide,
Gondola rides with you by my side.
The Netherlands’ fields, where tulips bloom,
Pedaling bikes through a world of perfume.
Scandinavian snow, a winter so bright,
Walking in silence, holding you tight.
Great Britain’s lanes, old and refined,
Sipping the best tea, your hand holding mine.
Across the US, from coast to coast,
Each journey a memory we’d cherish the most.
Brazil’s beaches, the sun’s golden glow,
Dancing through carnival, hearts in tow.
Egypt’s sands, where the pyramids rise,
We standing together under ancient skies.
Japan’s gardens, serene and wide,
Cherry blossoms falling as we walk side by side.
We’d watch sunsets from places afar,
From mountains, to beaches, beneath every star.
Exploring old streets, cultures to find,
Making memories, two souls intertwined.
We could have all of this ahead,
If only paths we chose were led.
Sunsets shared, with hearts aligned,
A love unbroken, gently kind.
Travels far and moments near,
Building a world that we hold dear.
Hand in hand, through joy and pain,
Finding magic in the mundane.
Each day a step toward the light,
Together strong, through darkest night.
A story written just for two,
A future bright, if only we knew.
We could have all this, and more,
A life worth living, to its core.
I would love to spend my life with you,
In all you are, the pure and true.
Your brightness lights the darkest skies,
Your kindness melts the coldest ice.
Your honesty, a rarest art,
That fills with warmth the deepest heart.
The way you share both joy and care,
Makes every burden light to bear.
Each moment shared becomes a treasure,
A timeless joy, beyond all measure.
With you, the world feels vast and new,
Our bond a light that guides us through.
To dream, to build, to truly be,
A world that’s ours, just you and me.
A love that grows, both strong and bright,
With you, my days are pure delight.
I’d give my all to make this true,
A life forever spent with you.
Could we build this life so grand,
With shared devotion, hand in hand?
For dreams require hearts aligned,
A mutual spark, a love combined.
Change must bloom on both our sides,
Or paths diverge, and hope subsides.
If one holds on while the other turns away,
The bond we share will fade and fray.
It takes two hearts, both brave and true,
To make this vision come to view.
Without that will, we’d drift apart,
Each living life with a separate heart.
And if I ever have a daughter, kind,
I’d hope her soul reflects your mind.
I’d show her how to nurture peace,
To let her love and care increase.
She’d hold her head with poise untold,
Yet carry warmth that feels like gold.
Her gentle steps, her thoughtful gaze,
I’d show her how to love with grace.
Your elegance, your tender heart,
In her, those traits would play their part.
The way she’d cherish simple things,
Would echo how your spirit sings.
Her words would flow like gentle streams,
A heart attuned to hopes and dreams.
With wisdom carved from patience deep,
She’d guard the hearts she vows to keep.
Though questions rise and answers wait,
I trust God’s plan, His chosen date.
He never rushes, never delays,
Each moment shaped in wondrous ways.
For what is best, He will provide,
His wisdom vast, our perfect guide.
In trials deep, in joy’s embrace,
I see His hand, His boundless grace.
He knows what’s right for every heart,
And weaves His good in every part.
No tear is lost, no prayer ignored,
He moves in love, our faithful Lord.
So I will trust and not despair,
For God is just, and always there.
In every season, dark or bright,
He leads us through with holy light.
Our broken past, He makes it whole,
He saves the weary, heals the soul.
And clears the guilt we can’t repay,
In name of Jesus Christ we say.
